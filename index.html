    <h2>Scope and Motivation</h2>
    <p>To motivate the development of WebRTC 1.0, the IETF RTCWEB WG developed [[RFC7478]].
    This document describes use cases motivating the development of
    "WebRTC Next Version" (WebRTC-NV), and the requirements deriving from those use cases.
    The use cases fall into one of two categories:
    enhancements to use cases already covered in [[RFC7478]], and
    new use cases which are not supported in WebRTC 1.0 [[WEBRTC]] without extensions.</p>

      <p>The uses cases in this section improve upon use cases described in [[RFC7478]].</p>
   <section id="multipartygame*">
      <h3>Multiparty online game with voice communications</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.3.12 describes a use case involving a multiparty online game
        with voice communications. In these scenarios, reducing time to join the game and
        receive media is important. To minimize this, ICE enhancements are desirable, such as
        the ability to control candidate gathering and pruning.  Also, allowing a participant
        to broadcast a configuration to a “room” abstraction (maintained on a server), with
        other room participants responding back directly, avoiding a separate discovery step,
        minimizes conference establishment time. Also, managing audio quality and latency in
        a fair manner between multiple connections prevents queue buildup. Supporting this
        enhancement adds the following requirements:</p>

      <h3>Video Conferencing with a Central Server</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.4.3.1 describes a use case involving Multiparty Video Communications with
      a central conferencing server. In such a use case, clients with disparate capabilities such as
      differing bandwidth availability,
      screen size and maximum displayable frame rate may participate in the same conference.
      In such a situation it is advantageous to support Scalable Video Coding (SVC).
      Encoding with temporal scalability is supported by several browsers today and is utilized by most
      centralized conferencing services.</p>
      <p>It is expected that spatial scalability (supported by VP9 and AV1) will become more popular with time.
      In this use case, if the desired video codec is known beforehand and participants are muted by default
      (as in a very large meeting), it is desirable to allow new participants to start receiving immediately,
      without negotiation. Supporting this enhancement adds the following requirements:</p>

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>In a web game called “NameTheBird.com” participants use their devices to provide audio and video observations of
birds to the service along with identifications for training purposes, allowing the service to identify birds from
the provided audio and video and returning this information to the users in real-time.</p>
<p>The web application has a site specific federated learning-based classifier for contextual object detection,
user intent prediction and media manipulation, allowing it to augment the streams it receives and inject identifying
or other supplemental information into the streams sent or received.</p>
<p>The shared classification models are trained on the birds found by the participants and are based on the feedback
of the participants. Each device client updates of the model are up-streamed to a shared model server that pushes
updates of the global model to the clients.</p>
<p>Implementation outline:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Originating media (raw) streams are cloned for inference and training purposes, denoted “inference stream” and
  “training stream”, with the inference stream also being the media stream shared with peer(s). The cloning can occur
  any time during a session.</li>
  <li>Inference stream: A web site specific classifier acts on the raw inference stream, with the result used to
  guide a custom encoder in the sender device and send metadata to the server and peer devices outside the media stream.
  The encoder adds proper augmentation, e.g. sign with “name this bird” hovering over the enlarged bird in case of video
  enrichment, or enhanced bird song if audio.</li>
  <li>Training stream: Model in training classifies the raw data and evaluate the classification using user feedback,
  said feedback loop being web site specific. The evaluation may be  “online” or “offline”, offline meaning the training
  is done at a later stage on the recorded encoded media set.</li>
  <li>Both inference stream and training streams may use payload protection depending on trust model on compute
  resources for optional intermedia server side of app.</li>
  <li>Both inference stream and training streams use transport object for communicating with peers or servers,
  the communication in some cases can be a site specific QUIC based transport solution, in others RTP based.</li>

<h3>Don't Pown My Video Conferencing </h3>
<p>
  Cloud video conferencing systems have no need to be able to access
  the cleartext media and text flowing through their servers.
  Some of these conferencing services desire to be able to promote trust
  by explicitly showing they do not have access to contents of their
  users' calls. They are trusted to connect the right people to the
  conference and to route the packets but they are not trusted to access
  the audio and video media or text in the call.
</p>
<p>Solutions to this problem fall into two major categories: one where
  the JavaScript comes from a source trusted to see the media contents,
  and one where it does not.
</p>
<section id="untrusted*">
<h4>Untrusted JavaScript Cloud Conferencing</h4>
<p>
  There are many cases where a system such as WebEx is trusted to
  connect the members of a conference but has no need to access the
  contents of the conference. This is true of the majority of
  conferencing systems on the web today.  Just to highlight the
  scope of this requirement, there are more minutes of WebRTC
  that are used in conferences where the servers have no need
  to access the contents (e.g. where audio is forwarded rather than
  mixed) than any other use of WebRTC audio by orders of magnitude.
  This is one of the primary use case for WebRTC audio and accounts
  for billions of minutes per month of potential use of WebRTC.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this use case, the JavaScript comes from the operator of the
  conference bridge. The isolated media features of WebRTC can
  prevent the JavaScript from accessing the media and the identity
  features are used to provide a user interface that allows the
  user to know it connected to the correct conference. The goal is
  for the end users to be able to see the contents, but the web
  service that provides the JS and the media switching bridges
  and Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) cannot access the contents
  (audio, video, text). The browser may choose to reveal some
  metadata, such as the audio power level, to the media server,
  in order to support functions like speaker switching.
</p>
<p>
  A possible solution this problem is the browser to negotiate
  end-to-end encryption keys which are not revealed to the
  JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  Security requirements relating to this use case are discussed
  in [[MLS-ARCH]], and include the following:
