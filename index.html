    <h2>Scope and Motivation</h2>
    <p>To motivate the development of WebRTC 1.0, the IETF RTCWEB WG developed [[RFC7478]].
    This document describes use cases motivating the development of
    "WebRTC Next Version" (WebRTC-NV), and the requirements deriving from those use cases.
    The use cases fall into one of two categories:
    enhancements to use cases already covered in [[RFC7478]], and
    new use cases currently not implementable in WebRTC 1.0.</p>.

      <h3>Multiparty online game with voice communications</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.3.12 describes a use case involving a multiparty online game with voice communications.
      In these scenarios, reducing join time is important. To minimize this, ICE enhancements are desirable, such as
      the ability to control candidate gathering and pruning.  Also, “parallel forking” minimizes conference
      establishment time by allowing a participant to broadcast an Offer to a “room” abstraction (maintained on a
      server), with other room participants responding back directly to the Offerer, avoiding a separate discovery step.
      Finally, the ability to support early media enables media to be received from responders before they answer the call.
      Also, the ability to impose a bandwidth limit across all mesh endpoints limits the build up of queues that can
      affect audio quality or perceived latency in the game. Supporting this enhancement adds the following requirements:</p>

   REQ-ID          DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N01             The user agent can control candidate gathering
                   and pruning, limiting the networks on which
                   candidates are gathered, the types of candidates,
                   etc.
   N02             The user agent must be able to support parallel
                   forking, including reuse of local ICE candidates
                   and local certificates with multiple Answerers.

                   limit across mesh endpoints.
   N04             Early media must be supported.

      <h3>Video Conferencing with a Central Server</h3>
      <p>[[RFC7478]] Section 2.4.3.1 describes a use case involving Multiparty Video Communications with
      a central conferencing server. In such a use case, clients with disparate capabilities such as differing bandwidth availability,
      screen size and maximum displayable frame rate may participate in the same conference.
      In such a situation it is advantageous to support Scalable Video Coding (SVC).
      Encoding with temporal scalability is supported by several browsers today and is utilized by most
      centralized conferencing services.</p>
      <p>It is expected that spatial scalability (supported by VP9 and AV1) will become more popular with time.
      In this use case, if the desired video codec is known beforehand and participants are muted by default
      (as in a very large meeting), it is desirable to allow new participants to start receiving immediately,
      without negotiation. Supporting this enhancement adds the following requirements:</p>
<pre class="example highlight">
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   REQ-ID          DESCRIPTION
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N07             The user agent must be able to encode and decode
                   video utilizing temporal scalability and (if
                   supported by the chosen codec) spatial scalability.
   N08             A user agent can receive audio/video without a
                   corresponding sender.
   N09             It is possible to select the sending and/or
                   receiving codec without negotiation.
   N10             The user agent must have control over the level
                   of robustness (RTX, RED, FEC) applied to simulcast
                   and SVC layers.

<p>This use case has been implemented by conferencing services utilizing [[ORTC]],
as well as proprietary additions to [[WEBRTC10]].</p>

    <h2>New Use Cases</h2>
<p>Several new uses cases relate to scenarios that cannot be supported in [[WEBRTC10]].</p>

<h3>File Sharing</h3>

   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   N11             It must be possible for the user agent to

   N12             The application must be able to signal backpressure
                   (flow control) when receiving data. It must also
                   receive a backpressure signal when sending data.
   N13             It must be possible for the user agent to transfer
                   data utilizing a congestion control algorithm
                   that does not compete aggressively with
                   audio/video communications.
   N14             It must be possible for the file exchange to
                   be supported by servers as well as user agents.
   N15             It must be possible to support data exchange
                   in a service worker.

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>In a web game called “NameTheBird.com” participants use their devices to provide audio and video observations of
birds to the service along with identifications for training purposes, allowing the service to identify birds from
the provided audio and video and returning this information to the users in real-time.</p>
<p>The web application has a site specific federated learning-based classifier for contextual object detection,
user intent prediction and media manipulation, allowing it to augment the streams it receives and inject identifying
or other supplemental information into the streams sent or received.</p>
<p>The shared classification models are trained on the birds found by the participants and are based on the feedback
of the participants. Each device client updates of the model are up-streamed to a shared model server that pushes
updates of the global model to the clients.</p>
<p>Implementation outline:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Originating media (raw) streams are cloned for inference and training purposes, denoted “inference stream” and
  “training stream”, with the inference stream also being the media stream shared with peer(s). The cloning can occur
  any time during a session.</li>
  <li>Inference stream: A web site specific classifier acts on the raw inference stream, with the result used to
  guide a custom encoder in the sender device and send metadata to the server and peer devices outside the media stream.
  The encoder adds proper augmentation, e.g. sign with “name this bird” hovering over the enlarged bird in case of video
  enrichment, or enhanced bird song if audio.</li>
  <li>Training stream: Model in training classifies the raw data and evaluate the classification using user feedback,
  said feedback loop being web site specific. The evaluation may be  “online” or “offline”, offline meaning the training
  is done at a later stage on the recorded encoded media set.</li>
  <li>Both inference stream and training streams may use payload protection depending on trust model on compute
  resources for optional intermedia server side of app.</li>
  <li>Both inference stream and training streams use transport object for communicating with peers or servers,
  the communication in some cases can be a site specific QUIC based transport solution, in others RTP based.</li>
